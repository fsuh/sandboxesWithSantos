//Write a function named greaterNum that: takes 2 arguments, both numbers. returns whichever number is the greater (higher) number. Call that function 2 times with different number pairs, and log the output to make sure it works(e.g. "The greater number of 5 and 10 is 10.”).

//Write a function named assignGrade that: takes 1 argument, a number score. returns a grade for the score, either "A", "B", "C", "D", or “F". Call that function for a few different scores and log the result to make sure it works.

//Write a function named pluralize that: takes 2 arguments, a noun and a number. returns the number and pluralized form, like "5 cats" or "1 dog”. Call that function for a few different scores and log the result to make sure it works. Bonus: Make it handle a few collective nouns like "sheep" and “geese"
